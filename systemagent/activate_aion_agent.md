Save Both Scripts: Save the Bash systemagent.sh code (v1.4.0 from previous answers) and the activate_aion_agent.sh code (above) into the same directory on your host machine. For example, save them both in ~/aion_deployment/.
Make Activator Executable: Open a terminal on your host and run:
chmod +x ~/aion_deployment/activate_aion_agent.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the Activator: Execute the activation script from your host terminal:
~/aion_deployment/activate_aion_agent.sh
Use code with caution.
Bash
It will likely ask for your sudo password (for the host user) the first time it needs to run sudo cp or sudo chroot.
It will then copy, set permissions, and finally run systemagent.sh as the aion user inside the chroot. You'll see the output from the activation script followed by the output from systemagent.sh itself.
This gives you a convenient way to deploy and immediately run the Bash agent script inside the chroot environment with the correct user context.
